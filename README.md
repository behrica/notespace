# What does it mean?
Stay tuned -- a screencast is coming soon.

# Status
Experimental

# Goals

* Use any Clojure namespace, in any Clojure editor, as a notebook
  * [x] editing is done in your beloved editor
  * [x] rendering is done at the browser
  * [ ] typical workflow has almost zero latency in namespace evaluation
* Live reload experience
  * [ ] re-rendering of relevant notebook part(s)
* A nootebook is a sequence of notes
  * [x] a note represents a piece of computation and its output
  * [x] any note can be rendered independently
  * [x] the notebook's rendering is the concatenation of its notes' renderings
  * [x] a notes' rendering can depend on its code and its output
  * [x] the precise way it depends on them is configurable in an extensible way
  * [ ] a notes' rendering can depend on the stdout and stderr of its computation
  * [x] we remember notes' last rendering
  * [ ] we know if notes need a refresh (after code change)
* Everything can be a note
  * [x] function definition
  * [x] test
  * [x] code example
  * [x] data analysis
* But nothing *has* to be a note
* Different modes of refresh
  * [ ] Oz-like refresh-downwards-from-this-note
  * [x] refresh-this-note
  * [x] refresh-everything
