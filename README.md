# notespace

Notebook experience in your Clojure namespace.

## Goals

* Use any Clojure namespace, in any Clojure editor, as a notebook
  * editing is done in your beloved editor
  * rendering is done at the browser
  * no latency in namespace evaluation
* Live reload experience
  * re-rendering of relevant notebook part(s)
* Everything can be notebook notes 
  * function definitions
  * tests
  * code examples
  * data analyses
* But nothing *has* to be a note
* Different modes of refresh
  * Oz-like refresh-downwards-from-this-note
  * refresh-this-note
  * refresh-everything
