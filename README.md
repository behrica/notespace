# notespace

Notebook experience in your Clojure namespace

## What is it?

This library is an attempt to answer the following question: can we have a notebook-like experience in Clojure without leaving our favourite editor?

## Status

Everything here is considered experimental.

## Version 3
Version 3, under active development, is an attempt to rethink the user experience and internals of Version 2.

It follows some ideas at the discussions of [alternative notation](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/224153-notespace-dev/topic/alternative.20notation) and of [evaluation semantics](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/224153-notespace-dev/topic/evaluation.20semantics.20--.20suggested.20breaking.20change).

Several people's ideas and comments have affected this version.

You can see the evolving draft under the [v3 branch](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace/tree/v3).

### Remarks
* At the moment, this version depends on [cljfx](https://github.com/cljfx/cljfx), merely for its [state management abstractions](https://github.com/cljfx/cljfx#subscriptions-and-contexts). This means it will run only on JDK 11.

## Version 2
The current version at the master branch and at Clojars is Version 2.
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/scicloj/notespace.svg)](https://clojars.org/scicloj/notespace)

At the moment, it is used for documentation and testing at [ClojisR](https://github.com/scicloj/clojisr) and [ClojisR-examples](https://github.com/scicloj/clojisr-examples).

### Usage

See this [example namespace](./test/notespace/v2/tutorial_test.clj) and its [rendered html](https://scicloj.github.io/notespace/doc/notespace/v2/tutorial-test/index.html).

### Known issues
* Links to external resources (e.g., images in separate files) will appear at the rendered static html, but are currently invisible at the live-reload view.

## Discussion

Hearing your comments, opinions and wishes will help!

## Relation to other projects

There are several magnificent existing options for literate programming in Clojure: Marginalia, Org-Babel, Gorilla REPL, Pink Gorilla, Clojuopyter, Nextjournal, Saite, Oz. Most of them are actively developed.

Creating a separate alternative would be the least desired outcome of the current project. Rather, the hope is to compose and integrate well with some of the other projects. There has been some thoughts and experiments in that direction, and it seems promising.
